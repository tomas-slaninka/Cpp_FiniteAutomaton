# Cpp_FiniteAutomaton
This program will simulate work of Deterministic Finite Automaton. Also you will be able to transform non-deterministic automaton into determinitic one. You will also be able to edit automaton into its minimal form.

Tasks:
1. Determine for certain Deterministic Finite Automaton whether the word belongs to the language or not.
2. For non-deterministic Finite Automaton find determinitic one, which will be equal to the previous one.
3. For Deterministic-Finite Automaton find reduced (minimal) automaton.
